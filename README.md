# Helios Sun Tracker

## Noun: Greek sun god, son of Hyperion, depicted as driving his chariot across the sky from east to west each day.
Helios uses data from the US Naval Observatory to accurately depict the position of the sun at any location on Earth.

From professional photographers keeping track of the golden hour to farmers learning from the past, Helios helps you keep track of the sun. By default, Helios will show you real time solar data for your current location. You can also enter a city and date to see information for any year between 1700 and 2100.
